I've been assigned to San Antonio three times since 2007, and in that time San Antonio has changed a lot!  I've worked on Brooks City-Base, Lackland, and Port San Antonio.  I've lived in Schertz, in Alamo Heights, next to the Pearl Brewery, by the airport, and on the West side.

I love this town and want to help other people love it too.  This wiki is designed to share information relevant to military members moving to San Antonio.  If it's helpful please share it more broadly.  If you'd like to change some of the content, please use the edit button!
