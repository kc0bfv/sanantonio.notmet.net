Are you a military member assigned to San Antonio for the first time?  This website is for you.

I'm an [Air Force officer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karl-sickendick/) that has been assigned to San Antonio three times since 2007.  I've worked on Brooks City-Base, Lackland, and Port San Antonio.  I've lived in Schertz, in Alamo Heights, next to the Pearl Brewery, on the West side, and near the airport.

I love this town, and want to help other people love it too.
