# Lackland Schools

Generally well-liked, from what I've heard.

# Randolph and Fort Sam Houston Schools

Uncertain reputation - please recommend any experiences by editing this.

# Northside Independent School District (ISD)

Large, along the West side, covering housing primarily servicing Lackland and Port San Antonio.  Considered one of the better school districts.

# North East ISD

Large, along the North side, especially Stone Oak.  Reasonable commutes to most basing.  Considered one of the better school districts.

# Alamo Heights

Small, covering Alamo Heights and some small surroundings.  Considered, perhaps, the best district in SA.  Easy commutes to most basing, but house prices here are quite expensive.

# San Antonio ISD

Generally not considered a strong school district.

# Judson ISD

Northeast area, near Randolph.  Uncertain about reputation.

# Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City ISD

Northeast area, near Randolph.  Reasonable reputation.

# Resources
