San Antonio is often called "military city, USA", and it lives up to that name.  The population is generally friendly to everybody, and they're very friendly to the military.

Joint Base San Antonio is comprised of several installations.

* Randolph AFB is on the Northeast side, actually located in Universal City just outside San Antonio.
* Lackland AFB is on the Southwest side, on Highway 90.  Lackland AFB is bisected by Military Highway, with the "Training Side" on the West, and the rest on the East.  It's best to avoid the Training Side and to avoid interfering with Basic Training, but Dunn Dental, several venues, the personnel flight, clothing sales, and some other things are only on Training Side.  Lackland also has the "Chapman Annex", formerly the "Medina Annex", a little West of Lackland proper.
* Port San Antonio shares its airfield with Lackland.  Port SA used to be called Kelly AFB.  Port San Antonio is owned by the city, and is mixed commercial/residential/military.  Kelly AFB was Kelly Field, and was one of the first Air Force installations.
* Fort Sam Houston is in the heart of the city.
* Camp Bullis is on the Northwest side.  It is a large installation, comprised mostly of isolated training range compatible with its training mission.  I know of no reason to visit Camp Bullis unless you're assigned to train there.
* Brooks City-Base used to be Brooks AFB, and was also an early Air Force installation.  It is now owned by the city of San Antonio, used for commercial purposes, and has no military personnel assigned.
* There are many other military locations around town, and many more businesses contracted by the military for their space.
