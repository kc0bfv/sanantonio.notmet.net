# Billeting

I've not stayed on Lackland, but have not been impressed with the options I've seen.  Currently availability is not visible online.

I have stayed on Randolph, and the rooms were very nice.  Availability is visible [here](https://af.dodlodging.net/propertys/JBSA---Randolph-).  Randolph is located just outside San Antonio on the Northeast side.  If you plan to be in that area, I recommend considering Randolph.  If you will not be in that area, consider other options due to commute length.

I've also stayed on Fort Sam Houston, and the rooms were fine.  These are managed through IHG, and that means they provide breakfast.  Availability is visible [here](https://www.ihg.com/armyhotels/hotels/us/en/fort-sam-houston/mfsha/hoteldetail).  Fort Sam is centrally located, so commuting anywhere else in the city is fairly easy.

# Hotels

Riverwalk hotels are popular, fun, and centrally located.  You can regularly get them at gov rates, or find deals, although your parking will almost certainly be extra.  It's easy to get anywhere else in town from downtown.  The Drury Inn, Riverwalk, is a fantastic option because of its free appetizers and drinks.

Out by Alamo Ranch there are a number of hotels.  The ones along 151 near Westover Hills Blvd are popular, and provide easy access to Lackland and the housing areas around Alamo Ranch and Sea World.

Across the North side, nice hotels are near loop 1604 from Alamo Ranch (West side) around to Randolph (East side).  Those are perfect if you're primarily house-hunting around there.

# Staying for Weeks, not Days

I don't have any experience doing this in San Antonio.  Please edit this with any recommendations you have.
